# Node-Article-One

You’ve probably heard of Node.js as being an “asynchronous JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine”, and that it “uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient”. But for some, that is not the greatest of explanations. 

What exactly does it mean for Node to be “asynchronous”, and how does that differ from “synchronous”? What is Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine, and what is the meaning “event-driven” and “non-blocking” anyway?

We’ll attempt to answer all of these questions and more throughout this article as we build a simple Bookshelf API utilizing a variety of third-party NPM modules – including Express, Mongoose, and Lodash.

### Blocking/Non-Blocking and Synchronous/Asynchronous

Suppose we are making a database call to retrieve properties about a user. That call is going to take time, and if the request is "blocking", then that means it will block the execution of our program until the call is complete. In this case, we made a “synchronous” request since it ended up blocking the thread.

So, a *synchronous* operation *blocks* a process or thread until that operation is complete, leaving the thread in a "wait state". An *asynchronous* operation, on the other hand, is *non-blocking*. It permits exectution of the thread to proceed regardless of the time it takes for the operation to complete or the result it completes with, and no part of the thread falls into a wait state at any point.

Let's look at another example of a *synchronous* call that *blocks* a thread. Suppose we are building an application that compares the results of two Weather APIs to find their percent difference in temperature. In a blocking manner, we make a call to Weather API one, and wait for the result. Once we get a result, we call Weather API two, and wait for its result.
